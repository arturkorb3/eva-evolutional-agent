EVA is a small, self-evolving LLM driven agent. A tiny **immutable kernel** boots a single **seed** release; from there EVA can rewrite, test, and promote new
versions of *itself* inside a hardened Docker sandbox. The bet is the design:
keep the core minimal, let capabilities grow only when real use demands them, and
make every self-change a **gated, reversible** step — never live surgery on a
running system.

## The idea in one picture

```
bootstrap (once)
  organism.py ──seeds──▶ seed/v001 ──materialize──▶ runtime/releases/v1
 (immutable kernel)       (genome, hash-pinned)        (first live release)

evolution loop
  runtime/releases/vN ──EVA edits──▶ vN-candidate ──gates──▶ promote ──▶ vN+1
        ▲                                                                  │
        └──── vN+1 becomes the live release · rollback steps back ─────────┘
                        (every promotion recorded in the ledger)
```

- **`organism.py`** is the kernel: ~300 lines, baked into the image, **not**
  editable by the agent. It seeds `v001`, runs the final promotion gate, records a
  release **ledger**, and can **roll back** through it.
- **`seed/v001/`** is the genome — real, reviewable, hash-pinned files. The kernel
  verifies their SHA-256 before materializing them into `runtime/`.
- **`runtime/releases/vNNN/`** are the live, evolvable versions. EVA edits a
  *candidate*, the gates test it, and only then does EVA **swap itself** for it.

## Architecture: one clean seam

The core talks only to **collaborators**, never to a provider or a terminal
directly. That single seam is what keeps EVA portable and lets it rewrite any
layer without re-inventing the loop.

| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `core.py` | Provider-neutral turn loop + the `Event`/`Tool`/`ToolCall` types. Knows nothing about OpenAI, CLIs or wire formats. |
| `adapters.py` | `ModelAdapter`s: `openai_chat` (native tool calls or a portable JSON-text fallback) and an offline `fake` for tests. |
| `tools.py` | Canonical tools + sandboxed runtime + the explicit **mode-policy table** (who may write/shell/promote). |
| `human.py` | `HumanInterface` + `ApprovalPolicy` (approve `[y/N/f]`; **`f`** reveals the full command) + host clipboard bridge. |
| `session.py` | Append-only event log = the **source of truth**, with image **blobs** kept out of the log. |
| `context.py` | Deterministic, LLM-free **compaction** — sends the full log while it fits, then a condensed view. |
| `self_model.py` | **Generated** self-knowledge: EVA reads its own anatomy/skills/capabilities/policy on demand (it is not preloaded). |
| `tui.py` | The status view — human-readable, on-the-fly "what is EVA doing now". |
| `agent.py` | Wiring + the CLI/chat loop; the four modes; the friction backlog and improve-pivot. |
| `supervisor.py` | Release gates: required files, the **ratchet**, smoke, dry-runs, qualification rounds. |
| `tests.py` | LLM-free checks — the ratchet itself (every promotion runs them). |

Because the self-model is *generated from the live code*, EVA always knows the
release it is actually running and its current toolset — call `inspect_self`
(`overview` · `anatomy` · `skills` · `capabilities` · `policy`).

## Modes

`work`, `improve`, and `review` run as an **interactive chat**: started without a
task, EVA asks for your first message; reply after each turn; empty line or
`exit` ends it.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `work [task]` | Useful work in `workspace/`. Can inspect itself, but **never** edits its own code. |
| `review [task]` | Read-only inspection — no writes, no evolution. |
| `improve [task]` | **Directed** self-change — builds a gated candidate that implements *your* task. |
| `evolve [N]` | **Autonomous** self-change — EVA picks the improvement, announces it, then implements N rounds. |
| `<mode> resume` | Continue your previous (interactive) session — each mode keeps its own. |
| `status` / `rollback` | Show the active/last-good release / roll back along the ledger. |
| `reseed` | Re-seed `v001` from `seed/` after editing the genome (no rebuild — the seed is mounted). |

## How it evolves

Every session feeds a persistent **friction backlog** (`data/state/backlog.jsonl`):
real shell/model failures are recorded with an error-specific signature.
Usefulness is *grown from real failures*, not designed up front. When the same
friction recurs (default 3×), EVA offers to **pivot** to an `improve` cycle aimed
at the root cause — a clean phase change, never live mutation.

A self-change only goes live after it clears three guarantees:

1. **The ratchet** — a fix must add/strengthen a test; a candidate may never run
   *fewer* checks than the current release (counted by what actually executes,
   not by source text).
2. **Multi-level rollback** — every promotion is recorded in the release ledger,
   so `rollback` can step back more than one version.
3. **A constitution in the immutable kernel** — `kernel_gate` independently
   verifies a candidate keeps EVA's core identity (a friction memory + a
   self-improvement path) and rehashes the promoted release's manifest so it can
   never lie about its own content. These checks live where the agent can't edit
   them.

## Contained, not "safe"

Containment limits the *blast radius*; it does not make EVA trustworthy. EVA runs
inside a hardened container ([`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml)):

- non-root user, `cap_drop: ALL`, `no-new-privileges`, CPU/memory/PID limits
- **read-only root filesystem**; only `./data/{runtime,state,workspace,local}` are writable
- the kernel is baked into the image and **not** mounted — the agent can't touch it
- secrets come from `.env` at runtime, never baked into the image

Within that box EVA can extend its **own** runtime tooling without an image change:
a persistent writable HOME (`/eva/.local`) for `pip install --user`, static
binaries on `PATH`, and HTTP via Python `urllib` or `node` `fetch` (there is no
`curl`/`wget`). It **cannot** change the image or `organism.py`.

> **Residual risk:** the container has outbound network access (for the LLM API).
> For maximum isolation, point EVA at a local model and restrict egress.

## Quickstart

**Prerequisites:** Docker Desktop (Linux engine).

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env      # set EVA_MODEL + EVA_API_KEY (EVA_PROVIDER=openai_chat)
.\run.ps1 build                  # build the hardened sandbox image
.\run.ps1                        # start EVA (work mode); or: .\run.ps1 review
```

On Linux/macOS use `./run.sh` with the same commands. Other useful ones:

```powershell
.\run.ps1 improve "add a CHANGELOG and report it in work mode"   # directed self-change
.\run.ps1 evolve 3 --yes --allow-shell                           # hands-off (Docker contains it)
.\run.ps1 status        # active / last-good release
.\run.ps1 rollback      # step back along the release ledger
```

**Approvals.** Risky actions prompt `Approve shell? [y/N/f]` — press **`f`** to
reveal the full command/diff before deciding. Set `EVA_TUI_FULL=1` to expand
commands and output in the live view.

**Images.** With a vision-capable model, reference a local image path, Markdown
`![](shot.png)`, or type `/paste` for your latest screenshot. On Windows,
`run.ps1 work`/`improve` auto-stages clipboard screenshots (`Win+Shift+S` →
`/paste`); on the host, `/paste` reads the clipboard directly. Images are
externalized to `data/state/blobs/` to keep the event log small.

**Providers.** The core is provider-neutral; pick the adapter in `.env`:

| `EVA_PROVIDER` | Backend |
|---|---|
| `openai_chat` (default) | Any OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions endpoint (OpenAI, Azure, Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM, OpenRouter). |
| `fake` | Offline, deterministic — for smoke tests / dry runs (no key). |

`EVA_TOOL_MODE` selects `native` (function calling, default) or `json_text`
(portable fallback).

## Inspecting & resetting

Everything EVA does is persisted on the host under `./data/` (git-ignored):
`workspace/` (work product), `runtime/releases/` (every release + `CURRENT`/
`LAST_GOOD`), and `state/` (event log, blobs, friction backlog, supervisor/kernel
ledgers). Delete `data/` or run `reseed` to start fresh — the kernel re-seeds
`v001` from `seed/v001/`, the source of truth. **Evolution lives only in
`data/`** — back valuable changes into `seed/` (and commit) or a reseed loses them.

```
organism.py          immutable kernel (seed · gates · promote · ledger · rollback)
seed/v001/           the genome (layered, hash-pinned), baked into the image
  core.py adapters.py tools.py human.py session.py context.py
  self_model.py tui.py agent.py supervisor.py tests.py manifest.json
Dockerfile           hardened, non-root image (kernel + seed + Node.js)
docker-compose.yml   the sandbox (read-only fs, caps dropped, resource limits)
run.ps1 / run.sh     wrappers (build/work/improve/review/evolve/paste/reseed/rollback/status)
data/                created at runtime; all evolution lives here (git-ignored)
```

## Honest limitations

A research experiment, not production software.

- Qualification gates check structure/behavior; they don't yet exercise full live
  LLM/tool flows.
- The ratchet counts *executed* checks, but still can't prove a test body wasn't
  weakened in other ways.
- Context compaction is deterministic and rudimentary; one session per mode.
- Network egress is open by default (see residual risk above).
